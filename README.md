# Graphics engine

This repository contains only a demo video of a computer graphics engine in action. If you are an employer who would like to discuss the implementation of the engine, please contact me and we can do so through a video chat. In accordance with Professor Josh Davis's wishes, I will not be posting the code for the engine online; if it were posted, then students in his computer graphics classes would be able to use it for their homework.
